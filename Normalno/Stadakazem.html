        <h2>
            "Cafe Zale" in Krnjaca is a viral hit on social networks, especially on Instagram and YouTube, 
            where it has gathered a large number of followers and fans in a relatively short time.<br>
        <br>
            Unlike the expensive production of videos and make-up pictures on Instagram, 
            this social media channel does not simulate reality or present things from a more beautiful angle, but shows reality as it is.<br>
        <br>
            The concept itself is based on the fact that Dule and Prcko, the sons of the now famous Zale, 
            reopened their father's cafe "Cafe Zale" where they spontaneously began filming the guests and everyday horors inside.

            I just wanted to portray the situation, since this waiter job is really hard, mostly waiters drink with the guests who come to the bar, 
            you can't work sober with them. I also drink with them every day, they drink, but I also don't skip it...<br>
            <br>
            Cafe Zale is a cult event, that people should see, in fact, that in my opinion alcohol is a total failure, that you should have a limit in everything, even in that drink. 
            It can serve as an educational channel, so that people can see what alcohol does to a person, how far it can take you, to what stage, that in my opinion alcohol is worse than heroin, honestly, because it is legal...<br> - Dule said.

        <h2>
            In the beginning, the cafe was visited by locals, manual workers and people from the social margins. However, as word got out about Cafe Zale,
            thanks to social networks, it happened that incredibly wealthy people stopped by their place.<br>
            <br>
            It happened that in the parking lot there was a fleet of vehicles worth a million euros, that is, 7-8 vehicles that cost more than 100,000 euros. 
            They came purely to see and feel that atmosphere, because there is no such thing anywhere.<br>
            <br>
            The beginning, the work was based on occasional photos and pictures on social networks, 
            and later it took the form of a real reality program with permanent stars that Dule and Prcko placed to live in the "Hacienda" in Krnjaca.<br>
            <br>
            Now, videos with events from the lives of the main characters are recording everyday, and some participants have also recorded songs in serious production. 
            Many fans send donations for their favorite participants, and the earnings from the clips are redirected to the primary needs of the participants of this show.<br>

        Although at the beginning this program was based on drinking alcohol and going to bars, 
        Dule and Prcko directed the channel towards daily attempts to put the stumbling participants back on the right path and to pull them away from bad habits. 
        They helped many people financially, gave them a roof over their heads, helped them rebuild their houses, gave them clothes and took them on various trips. 
        But unfortunately, despite all of their hard work, many of them failed to get back on track.
